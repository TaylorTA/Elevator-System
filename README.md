# Elevator-System
Scenario: A hospital in a block of old buildings has a nearly-antique elevator that is at one end of a narrow
hallway on each floor. The elevator is so narrow that the people in it have to stand in one column. There is
a strict limit on the number of passengers because of its narrowness.
Patients and their families complained about the narrowness of the elevator causing claustrophobia, In
response to the complaints, management has restricted the use of the elevator to employees only, while
encouraging employees to stay healthy by taking the stairs where possible.
To minimize conflict getting on and off the narrow elevator in the narrow hallway, management had two
lines drawn on the floor to divide the hallway into three columns leading to and from the elevator:
- The first column is for employees waiting to go up on the elevator;
- The second column is for employees waiting to go down; and
- The third column is for employees who have exited the elevator to traverse the hall and go to their
destinations.
To maximize use of the elevator, everyone behaves as follows:
- At any floor, people waiting in a queue to get on the elevators are polite: people do not try to get on
the elevator until all people on the elevator who want to get off have exited the elevator.
- People only get on the elevator if the elevator is going in their desired direction. For example, when
the elevator is going up, only people who are going up get on and people waiting to go down do not
get on the elevator at that time
